# React Tutorial

## Setup

Make sure you have `vscode`, `nodejs` and optionally `yarn`.

In the root folder of this project setup with `npm install` or just `yarn` if you installed it.

Open this folder with `vscode` and install the recomended extensions to enable debugging on chrome.

## Tasks

To start the project use the start task in vscode or run `npm run start` this will run parcel on port [1234](http://localhost:1234).

React has a bit of magic when using jsx to see what's happening run the build task in vscode or run `npm run build`. This will produce a mirror of the src folder in dist but with all the code transpiled so you can see what's going on under the hood.

## Tutorial

We will be going through the react tutorial that can be found [here.](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#overview)

Each section of the tutorial will be seperated into seperate tags on this repo. Whenever the tutorial says `view the full code at this point` that will be the next tagged step in the form `step-[step number]`.

To see a basic hello world example of the project checkout step-0 to start the tutorial checkout step-1.
